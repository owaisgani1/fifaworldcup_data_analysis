# fifaworldcup_data_analysis

# Overview
This project analyzes the FIFA World Cup dataset to discover key metrics and factors that influence a team's chances of winning the World Cup. The dataset includes information about all the World Cups in history, while the World Cup Matches dataset shows all the results from the matches contested as part of the cups.

"Our project involved analyzing sports game data to extract meaningful insights. However, the data we worked with had several limitations. It was too noisy, had too many null values, and was too collinear, making it difficult to build a machine learning model. Despite this, we managed to build one, although it is not yet suitable for production.

We recognize that the data had limitations, particularly with regards to information about coaches, players, and injuries, which made it challenging to determine the exact winner of each game. Additionally, the data was imbalanced. However, we were able to address these issues using statistical methods.

Despite these challenges, we believe that our project has value and that others can benefit from our findings. Anyone is welcome to use our project and build upon it. If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, please feel free to contact us at nimitzuss90@gmail.com."
